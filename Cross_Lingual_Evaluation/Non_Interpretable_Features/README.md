## Non-interpretable approaches: x-vectors and TRILLsson
To run the code, the SpeechBrain toolkit is required.

The whole experiment pipeline can be run through `run_all_experiments.sh`. Please set the paths of data set directory, feature directory, and output result directory before running. The feature folder needs to contain sub-folders *xvector* and *trill*. Access to the JHU CLSP grid is required to run the experiments with the data sets we experimented on. All experiment output results will be saved in the *output* directory.
