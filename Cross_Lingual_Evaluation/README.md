### A Cross-lingual Evaluation of Interpretable and Non-interpretable Approaches for Automatic Detection of Parkinson's Disease from Language and Speech

## Set up  ‚öôÔ∏è 

```
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/Neuro-Logical/speech.git
$ cd Cross_Lingual_Evaluation/

# Create a virtual environment
$ python3 -m virtualenv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the dependencies within the working environment with exact versions
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data pre-processing üìà
Recordings from both the data sets were resampled to 16 kHz as required by the algorithms used for the feature extraction. To resample speech recordings to 16kHz, run the script: 
  
  ```
  $ bash Data_prereprocessing/convert_to_16k.sh 
  ```

   - To extract speech transcripts from speech recordings using openAI Whisper (https://openai.com/blog/whisper), run:

   ```
      python Data_preprocessing/extract_transcripts.py
   ```
