But maybe mom shouldn't make cookies so often so. anyway, she needs to shut the water off though and finish up the dishes but, you know, they could have a bath there after that's all done. so i guess the it's a kitchen'll be flooded so that's okay. uhm, it looks like it's a nice day out. maybe she should send the kids out with the cookie jar. well that would be fun. then she can make more cookies and do more dishes.   \n",

Uhm, in a addition because her children are sneaking into the cookie jar and the one who was the boy who was on the stool is about to tips a stool over and maybe she will notice actually when he crashes to the floor and that maybe when she looks at him she'll also notice all that water she's standing in. and i see cabinets, uhm i see a bush outside. she is wearing a dress and probably an apron. so she's probably like a nineteen fifty's mother and although that dress length might be more like nineteen sixty, i don't know. ah dress.   \n",

Uhm, his mother, their mother is uhm, not for sure of course, is turned away from them and does not see this happening. it's not clear, she probably didn't hear it either because of the waterfall that she has created presumably in the sink uhm or maybe it just got stopped up and she's day dreaming but anyway there's a waterfall from the sink. she's drying a dish. Uhm, i'm not sure what that, oh bushes and a wing outside but she's standing in the water.   \n",

Apparently his youngest sister reaching up for the cookie. The mother is drying dishes, oblivious to the fact that the sink is overflowing. Looking out the window, you see their drive where the curtains are pulled back. ah I see trees, curtains and mom standing in the water. it's all in black and white. I don't see to let us of course off the cookie jar. kid's about to fall on his can. and nobody seems to be interested in the thing. I don't know many more seconds I have to go. There are some dishes on the sink or I should say on the counter and it's about it. and he bushes in front of the house vaguely trees in the right back.   \n",

But maybe mom shouldn't make cookies so often so. anyway, she needs to shut the water off though and finish up the dishes but, you know, they could have a bath there after that's all done. so i guess the it's a kitchen'll be flooded so that's okay. uhm, it looks like it's a nice day out. maybe she should send the kids out with the cookie jar. well that would be fun. then she can make more cookies and do more dishes.   \n",
